Every time when I want to search in US google, I open a new tab for google.com from bookmark.
It's a little pain because I have to use mouse/touchpad to do so.
That's why I created this chrome extention.

[How to work]
- Press Ctrl+Q to open google.com
- Press Ctrl+Shift+Q to open google.co.jp

[How to install]
Please search "Open Google US/JP" in chrome web store.
